<h2> Description :</h2>

    <p>
        My name is Anthony Bellinger, and I am currently a Senior at Michigan State University, 
        where I began my academic journey in 2023. I am pursuing a degree in Information Science 
        with a focused track in Information Technology and Cybersecurity. My studies have equipped 
        me with a solid technical foundation, a forward-thinking mindset, and a clear commitment 
        to advance within the IT and cybersecurity career fields. I'm an extremely goal-oriented, 
        passionate, and motivated person that takes on any challenges that come my way.
